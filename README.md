# Uploader
This is a small and super simple programm to share files across the network. It is tested on Windows, Linux and Mac but should be compilable to every system where gcc/clang exists.

### Usecase:
Do you know these situation? There is your friend and you want him to give you file, a big file like a virtual machine image or a film. But he has a Mac and you have a Linux PC? So how do you do it well of course you could use dropbox if you have a realy realy fast internet. Or you could use pythons SimpleHTTPServer. The python Server is realy slow allow only one connection at the same time and if he wants to also give you a file you also have to start a server. So this a ok solution but nothing fancy. Well exatly this situation I have like once all three month or so. And here is where Uploader is a good solution it pretty fast, it allows multiple connection, its very small and simple! Nothing fancy but it just works and thats what I wanted.

### Why did you programmed it in Nim?
Because I wanted to learn the language. Thats also why its written so poorly I learned the language as I used it. But I really can recommend Nim it's fun try it :)

### Why doesn't it have feature XYZ?
Probably because I didn't needed it. But if you want a feature please let me know I may will implement it in the future. If you can code by yourself you also can send me a patch. Or you can just fork it and implement it by yourself :)
